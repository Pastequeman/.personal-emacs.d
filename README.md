## Ian's use-package Emacs configuration

### Thanks for dropping by!
This is my personal Emacs configuration (on GNU Emacs 26.2). It's unopinionated and was created for general use in mind.

This Emacs config starts up **super fast** with an average init time of 0.4 to 0.6 seconds.

### Installation
Back up your `~/.emacs.d/` first (if you have one):

Git clone my configuration to your new `~/.emacs.d/` :

### "Rolling" Release
I will constantly push new commits since *a real Emacser* is never completely satisfied with his/her setup.

## Packages that I use:

#### Package Manger
- use-package

#### Vim Editing habits (Optional depending on your preferences)
- evil

#### Git integration
- magit

#### Better Emacs defaults
- company (autocompletion)
- ido-vertical-mode
- yasnippets
- dashboard (welcome screen)

#### Org mode

#### File management
- ranger

#### Friendly warnings
- flycheck

#### Lightweight syntax highlight improvement for all languages
- highlight-operators
- highlight-numbers
- highlight-escape-sequences

- doom-themes (I use doom-tomorrow-night)
