### Thanks for dropping by!
This is my personal Emacs configuration (on GNU Emacs 26.2). If you wish for an unopinionated Emacs "distro" that you could build upon, check out this page: https://github.com/ianpan870102/.emacs.d

### Installation
Back up your `~/.emacs.d/` first (if you have one):

```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
```

Git clone my configuration to your new `~/.emacs.d/` :
```
git clone https://github.com/ianpan870102/.use-package.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

### "Rolling" Release
I will constantly push new commits since *a real Emacser* is never completely satisfied with his/her setup.
